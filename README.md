# Gaitcome

Gaitcome is a low-cost 3D tracking system that extracts objective (medical industry) data using computer vision.

## Gaitcome Web 
[Gaitcome Web](https://gaitcome.com/homepage) is a web platform that presents kinematic results (extracted objective data) in an understandable user interface using interactive graphics (time v.s angles) of the knee, hip, ankle, and heels.

### Technologies Used
Gaitcome is built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) and Material Design. We also utilize Matlab, Typescript, Highchart, Postman, and AWS.

### App Functionalities

- Handled client inquiries and requirements during the construction of the web platform.
- Implemented frontend and backend for multiple role registrations and logins (patient and medical center).
- Created the ability to ingest objective kinematics data from infrared camera sensors.
- Developed a dashboard displaying kinematics results for patients, medical centers, and therapists.
- Implemented a new appointment interface with the option to reschedule appointments.
- Created visualizations for time vs. angles and graphics depicting sagittal, transversal, and frontal views of the knee, hip, ankle, and heels.
- Developed a desktop application version of the web solution for specific customers (REST API access).
